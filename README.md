# 3D Rendering / Game Engine Built by Alex Patrick

Originally solely built for a side project of making Pong from scratch,
but I am now trying to adapt and generalize it for more projects.
Currently (11/24/2024), the engine has two rendering backends:

- GLFW with Vulkan
- SDL2.

Ideally, I would like to expand the Vulkan engine to support audio, text, and textures.
